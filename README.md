# Unnamed community/forum website project

## About
This project is about making reddit-like website with Spring Boot framework.

## Key features
The project aims the website to have two major features
1. Content moderation by everyone not by few moderators
2. Guest account is enough to enjoy the website (Signing up is optional)

    ### 1. Content moderation
    To prevent excessive or biased censorship by small number of people, there are no moderators.
    
    Instead, all contents have up/down vote system.
    
    When some contents get too many downvotes, they go to the bottom of the list and faded so users can find that those contents are not good.

    ### 2. Guest account
    Users can post, comment and vote without having an actual account.
    
    They can sign up for the website, but it is completely up to them.
    
    This is for giving users as much freedom as possible.
